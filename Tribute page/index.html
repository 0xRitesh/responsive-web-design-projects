                        <p><strong>Nobel Laureate and Honorary Member Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman </strong> was born in 1888 in southern India. He received a B.S. in 1904 and an M.S. in 1907 from Presidency College, Madras. Because scientific research was almost completely neglected in India, Raman did not begin his career in physics. Instead, he took a civil service post in the finance department in Calcutta in 1907, and continued his scientific work in his spare time. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Over the next decade, he published some 30 papers in Nature, Philosophical Magazine and Physical Review—which helped to make his name familiar outside of India. In 1917, he was offered a physics appointment at Calcutta University. This marked the beginning of a very productive time in Raman’s life, which he termed his “golden era.” It extended from 1917 until 1933 and included multidisciplinary research in optics, acoustics and other branches of physics. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In 1918, Raman published the first in a series of experiments on the molecular diffraction of light, which led to his 1928 discovery of the Raman Effect. Using a very simple apparatus, he found that, when a beam of monochromatic light is scattered by a transparent medium, the scattered light has weak components of changed frequency, with the shift characteristic of the substance causing the scattering. Other scientists quickly verified his published results.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Other scientific investigations included his experimental and theoretical studies on the diffraction of light by acoustic waves of ultrasonic and hypersonic frequencies and those on the effects produced by X-rays on infrared vibrations in crystals exposed to ordinary light.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Raman was knighted in 1929 and awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for work on the scattering of light in 1930. He was also a member of the Royal Society of London. From 1933 until 1970, he continued his research at his laboratory in Bangalore, writing a book on the physiology of vision in 1968. He established the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore as well as the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian Journal of Physics.
                            <br>
                            Raman died in 1970.</p>
